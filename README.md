# Active ACO

## Overview
This repository includes implementations of the standard Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and an enhanced variant incorporating active inference, termed Active ACO. Active inference is based on the concept that perception is an active process, involving the minimization of free energy and continuous updating of beliefs based on environmental interactions. This project demonstrates how such concepts can improve traditional algorithms like ACO when applied to randomly generated graphs.

## Files
- `main.py`: Implementation of both ACO and ACO with Active Inference and a script for comparing ACO performances..

## Usage
Run `main.py` to generate graphs and compare the algorithms. Results are presented both numerically in tables and visually in plots.

## Requirements
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
